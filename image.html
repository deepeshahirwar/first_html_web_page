<h3>About the Bhagat Shingh</h3>  
<p style="font-size: 18px;">  
Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic  
Indian revolutionary[3] who participated in the mistaken murder of a  
junior British police officer[4] in what was to be retaliation for  
the death of an Indian nationalist.[5] He later took part in a  
largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi 
and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage 
in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab  
region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in 
Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] 
he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent 
introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually 
successful campaign for India's independence.[8]

<h3>About the Maharadh Pratap</h3> 

<p style="font-size: 18px;">  
Pratap Singh I, popularly known as Maharana Pratap  
(c. 9 May 1540 – 19 January 1597), was a Hindu Rajput king of Mewar from the Sisodia dynasty. He fought several major battles against Akbar including the Battle of Haldighati in 1576 to resist the expansionist policy of the Mughal empire. Pratap became a folk hero for his military resistance through guerrilla warfare which proved inspirational for later rebels against Mughals including Malik Ambar and Shivaji.
